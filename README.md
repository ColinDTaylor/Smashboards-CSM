Smashboards Community Symbol Map for Melee. Topic: http://smashboards.com/threads/smashboards-community-symbol-map.426763/

Hey! I'm Absolome and this is the Smashboards Community Symbol Map. In short, it's a project attempting to combine the knowlege of modders and tinkerers of Super Smash Brothers Melee. 

Melee's source code is lost so all we have to work with in terms of the game's code is the compiled assembly code (or ASM), which is cryptic and hard to work with. Each 'symbol' in the ASM is a function (of sorts) that can be given a name, this project sets out to name as many of those as possible in order to make modding for melee easier and more accessible.

Feel free to contribute! Just fork this repository and send a pull request when you're done editing whatever it is you'd like to edit in.

GALE01.map is the file you'll want to edit, for more information, look at the Smashboards topic
